# Credit-Scoring-Model
A credit scoring model predicts an individual's creditworthiness. It uses classification algorithms on financial data (income, debt, history) to assess risk. Key steps include feature engineering and evaluating model accuracy with metrics like Precision, Recall, and ROC-AUC. This helps lenders make informed decisions.
